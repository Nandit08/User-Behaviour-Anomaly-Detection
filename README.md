# User-Behaviour-Anomaly-Detection
KDD dataset from UCI repository is used for the project and a semi-supervised approach for the classification problem is implemented using Decision Trees and Kmeans
KDDâ€™99 has been the most wildly used data set for the evaluation of anomaly detection methods. KDD training data set consists of approximately 4,900,000 single connection vectors each of which contains 41 features and is labeled as either normal or an attack, with exactly one  specific attack type. Where as testing data consists of 311030 records with same number of features but testing has 40 types of attacks in it on other side training comprises of 21 types of attacks :
1. Denial of Service Attack (DoS)
2. User to Root Attack (U2R)
3. Remote to Local Attack (R2L)
4. Probing Attack
